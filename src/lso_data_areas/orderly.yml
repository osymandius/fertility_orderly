  ## Lesotho (LSO)
  Boundaries source: humdata.org
  Levels:
    * 1: District (10)
    * 2: Community Council (76 / 78 areas)
  Spectrum: National
  EPP: National
  EPP Urban/Rural: Yes
  PEPFAR PSNU: District (level 1)
  Notes: Lesotho is stratified by 10 districts and 76 community councils.
    However, the two community councils Maseru and Butha-Buthe span multiple
    districts. Consequently there are 78 areas in the community council level
    of the area hierarchy.
